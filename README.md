 EduTrack-Cpp

 Object-Oriented Student Management System in C++

---

 Overview
**EduTrack-Cpp** is a simple **Student Management System** built in **C++** to demonstrate core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
The system manages student data, grades, instructors, and graduate students with their research topics through a console-based interface.

---

 Features
✅ Manage student information (name, ID, grade)  
✅ Validate grades (0–100 only)  
✅ Allow instructors to update grades via a friend function  
✅ GraduateStudent class inherits from Student and adds a research topic  
✅ Static variable tracks total number of students created  
✅ Demonstrates constructors and destructors for object lifecycle
